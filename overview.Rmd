## Google Earth Engine Labs 

These labs introduce Google Earth Engine as a tool for performing geospatial data analysis. 

* **Preliminary Resource:** Introduction to JavaScript and programming concepts
* **Lab 4a:** Spatial data models and data structures
* **Lab 4b:** Spatial data visualisation
* **Lab 5:** Spatial and geometry operations
* **Lab 6:** Introduction to remote sensing concepts
* **Lab 7:** Machine Learning: Land cover classification
* **Lab 8:** Machine Learning: Predicting urban land surface temperatures
* **Lab 9:** Drought monitoring

A series of questions are posed throughout the lab as demonstrated below; these are to help you engage with the content, have a go at answering them and click on the question to reveal the answer.

## Google Earth Engine

Google Earth Engine is a platform for geospatial data analysis. It combines [databases of big geospatial datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) that are updated daily, a range of geospatial data analysis and processing functions similar to GIS and remote sensing software, and access to cloud computing resources to apply these functions to geospatial datasets. You can access Google Earth Engine through the [*Code Editor*](https://code.earthengine.google.com) - a web-based interactive development environment (IDE) for creating Google Earth Engine programs for geospatial data analysis and visualising the results in web maps, interactive charts, or text summaries.

[Gorelick et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717302900) provide a detailed description of the Google Earth Engine platform.

### Applications

Applications of Google Earth Engine span a variety of disciplines which utilise geospatial data:

* [Monitoring global forest change](https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest)
* [Mapping habitat ranges](http://species.mol.org/species/map/Perdix_dauurica)
* [Global water security](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/nature-water-unveiling-most-detailed-view-water-earth/)
* [Monitoring global croplands](http://www.g-feed.com/2015/05/introducing-scym.html)
* [Mapping travel time to urban centres](https://medium.com/google-earth/mapping-global-travel-time-to-urban-resources-448c1d7919d2)

More examples of how Google Earth Engine is used can be found on the [Google Earth Engine  blog](https://medium.com/google-earth/tagged/earth-engine).

## Useful Resources

There are a range user resources for Google Earth Engine. You should use these resources to supplement the work done in the labs. Becoming familiar with these resources will help you troubleshoot problems. Using these resources will develop your independent problem solving skills when undertaking geospatial data analysis. 

1. [Google Earth Engine introduction](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/) - comprehensive overview of Google Earth Engine's capabilities. 
2. [Google Earth Engine tutorials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials)
3. [Google Earth Engine for education](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/edu) - range of training resources. 
4. User Forum and help tab in the code editor (see below).

```{r gee-help, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Google Earth Engine user forum and help tab", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/help.png")
